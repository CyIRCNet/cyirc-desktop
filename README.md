# Building
Before you can build you will need to [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

To build the client for use simply run `./build.sh`.

To run the client you will need to install electron (`sudo npm -g install electron`) then enter the `client/` directory and type `electron .`.
